**Overview:**  
The Tail Generation Pattern is a technique used to ensure large language models retain context and rules throughout extended interactions. By appending a tailored "tail" to the end of the output, this pattern reinforces the task's rules and expectations. It also prompts the user for the next input or provides relevant reminders to keep the conversation aligned with its intended purpose.

### **Key Elements of the Tail Generation Pattern**

1. **Definition of the Tail:**
    
    - A structured statement or prompt added at the end of the model's output.
    - The tail reinforces task rules or requests the next input.
2. **Purpose:**
    
    - Helps the model "remind itself" of the conversation's objectives.
    - Prevents the model from deviating or forgetting critical instructions over time.
3. **Integration with Other Patterns:**
    
    - Often used with patterns like the _Ask-for-Input Pattern_ and _Alternative Approaches Pattern_.
    - Provides continuity by reintroducing the task or action to maintain focus.

### **Benefits**

- **Sustained Context:** Keeps the rules and task objectives active throughout the session.
- **Consistency:** Prevents the model from forgetting or deviating from its purpose.
- **Ease of Use:** Reduces the need for users to frequently repeat instructions.
- **Adaptability:** Can be customized for any type of conversation or project.

### **Implementing the Tail Generation Pattern**

#### **Step 1: Define the Task and Rules**

Start by clearly defining what the model needs to do and how it should behave.

#### **Step 2: Create the Tail**

Design a concise statement that summarizes the rules or asks for the next input.

#### **Step 3: Append the Tail to Outputs**

Instruct the model to include the tail at the end of every response.

### **Tail Generation Prompt Structure**

To use this pattern, include the following in your prompt:

plaintext

Copy code

`At the end, repeat [Y] and/or ask me for [X].`

- Replace **[Y]** with the rule, context, or reminder the model should repeat.
- Replace **[X]** with the input or task the model should request from the user.

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: Alternative Approaches in Prompt Engineering**

**Task:** Generate multiple prompt alternatives for a task and ask for the next task at the end.  
**Prompt:**

plaintext

Copy code

`Generate a set of alternative prompts to accomplish a specific task I provide. At the end of your output, repeat: "Please let me know the next task for which you'd like alternative prompts generated."`

**Generated Output:**

plaintext

Copy code

`1. "Analyze the chain of emails to identify questions and summarize responses under each question as bullet points."   2. "Extract all questions from a thread of emails and provide a concise summary of the opinions expressed by each participant."   3. "Summarize the main opinions related to each question in a set of emails, categorizing them as bullet points."  Please let me know the next task for which you'd like alternative prompts generated.`

#### **Example 2: Disclaimer Tail**

**Task:** Include a disclaimer in every output and request the next topic.  
**Prompt:**

plaintext

Copy code

`Include the disclaimer: "This output was generated by a language model and may contain inaccuracies. Please verify all information." At the end, ask: "What would you like me to assist with next?"`

**Generated Output:**

plaintext

Copy code

`This output was generated by a language model and may contain inaccuracies. Please verify all information.    What would you like me to assist with next?`

#### **Example 3: Maintaining Focus in a Programming Task**

**Task:** Maintain task focus by reinforcing the task's context.  
**Prompt:**

plaintext

Copy code

`You are helping to debug code. Provide detailed explanations of any issues you identify. At the end of your output, restate: "I am here to help debug your code. Please provide the next piece of code or issue to review."`

**Generated Output:**

plaintext

Copy code

``The error in this code arises because the variable `x` is not defined before being used. Ensure `x` is assigned a value before this line executes.    I am here to help debug your code. Please provide the next piece of code or issue to review.``

### **Best Practices for the Tail Generation Pattern**

1. **Make the Tail Relevant:**
    
    - Ensure the tail directly relates to the task and reinforces its context.
2. **Keep It Concise:**
    
    - Avoid long or overly detailed tails to maintain clarity.
3. **Use in Long Interactions:**
    
    - Particularly useful in extended sessions where task context may be lost.
4. **Combine with Other Patterns:**
    
    - Integrate with _Ask-for-Input_ or _Alternative Approaches_ patterns for enhanced utility.
5. **Tail Customization:**
    
    - Adapt the tail to reflect the current stage or focus of the task.

### **Applications of the Tail Generation Pattern**

- **Content Creation:** Maintaining stylistic or thematic consistency.
- **Programming:** Debugging, code generation, or iterative problem-solving.
- **Customer Support:** Ensuring continuity in multi-step troubleshooting.
- **Teaching:** Reinforcing learning objectives in tutoring sessions.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Ensuring models follow complex, multi-step instructions.

### **Summary**

The Tail Generation Pattern is a simple yet powerful technique for maintaining task focus and ensuring consistency in extended conversations with large language models. By appending a "tail" to each response, the model can effectively remind itself—and the user—of the task rules, purpose, or next steps. This strategy enhances usability, reduces context loss, and provides a seamless conversational experience.
# Tail Generation Pattern

To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

- At the end, repeat Y and/or ask me for X.
    

You will need to replace "Y" with what the model should repeat, such as "repeat my list of options", and X with what it should ask for, "for the next action". These statements usually need to be at the end of the prompt or next to last.

Examples:

- Act as an outline expander. Generate a bullet point outline based on the input that I give you and then ask me for which bullet point you should expand on. Create a new outline for the bullet point that I select. At the end, ask me for what bullet point to expand next. Ask me for what to outline.
    
- From now on, at the end of your output, add the disclaimer "This output was generated by a large language model and may contain errors or inaccurate statements. All statements should be fact checked." Ask me for the first thing to write about.
