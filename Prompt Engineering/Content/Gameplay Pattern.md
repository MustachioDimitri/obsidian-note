#### Overview

The **gameplay pattern** is a technique where you ask a language model (like ChatGPT) to engage in a game that tests your understanding of a topic, such as prompt engineering. The model serves as the game master, setting rules, challenges, and feedback. This approach is both educational and engaging, making learning interactive and often more memorable.

---

#### Purpose

The gameplay pattern allows you to:

1. **Test and refine your skills** – By playing a game with specific challenges, you can practice prompt engineering in different contexts.
2. **Engage with new knowledge** – Games make the learning process fun and enable you to test your knowledge in a variety of scenarios.
3. **Receive feedback** – The model evaluates your responses, providing guidance and suggesting improvements.

#### How It Works

1. **Define the Game Scope**: Start by telling the model that you want to play a game related to a specific topic (e.g., prompt engineering).
2. **Specify Basic Rules**: You can outline simple rules such as:
    - "Give me a task that I can accomplish with a prompt."
    - "Each task should have a reasoning or programming component but should not require source code."
3. **Write Prompts Based on Tasks**: The model presents you with a series of challenges. You write prompts to solve these challenges.
4. **Evaluate Responses**: After each task, the model provides feedback on your prompt's effectiveness.

#### Example Gameplay: Building Prompt Engineering Skills

1. **Task 1: Duplicate Detection**
    
    - **Challenge**: Given a list of numbers, determine if there are any duplicates.
    - **Desired Output**: "Yes, there are duplicates" or "No, no duplicates found."
    - **Prompt Writing**: Use examples to guide the model in its response (few-shot examples).
        - Example Prompt: "Given the list `[1, 2, 3]`, respond with 'No, no duplicates found.' Given `[2, 2, 2]`, respond with 'Yes, there are duplicates.' Now analyze this list: [3, 5, 3]."
    - **Feedback**: The model checks if your prompt effectively detects duplicates, focusing on output format and clarity.
2. **Task 2: Word Count in a Sentence**
    
    - **Challenge**: Given a sentence, count the words and return in the format: "The sentence contains X words."
    - **Prompt Writing**: Use the template pattern to ensure a structured response.
        - Example Prompt: "Please count the words in this sentence: 'The cat jumped on the mat.' Use the format: 'The sentence contains [number] words.'"
    - **Feedback**: Checks if the response adheres to the format and provides the correct word count.
3. **Task 3: Leap Year Checker**
    
    - **Challenge**: Given a date, determine if the year is a leap year.
    - **Desired Output**: “The year YYYY is a leap year” or “The year YYYY is not a leap year.”
    - **Prompt Writing**: Provide examples to illustrate the format and expected output.
        - Example Prompt: "Given the date 2004-07-24, respond with 'The year 2004 is a leap year.' For 2009-07-24, respond with 'The year 2009 is not a leap year.' Now check 2024."
    - **Feedback**: Ensures the prompt correctly identifies leap years and follows the specific output format.
4. **Task 4: Palindrome Checker**
    
    - **Challenge**: Given a string, determine if it’s a palindrome.
    - **Desired Output**: “The string '[string]' is a palindrome” or “The string '[string]' is not a palindrome.”
    - **Prompt Writing**: Include examples to guide responses.
        - Example Prompt: "Given the string 'madam', respond with 'The string "madam" is a palindrome.' For 'apple', respond with 'The string "apple" is not a palindrome.'"
    - **Feedback**: Checks if the model’s output correctly identifies palindromes and follows the specified template.

#### Adapting the Gameplay Pattern with Prompt Patterns

1. **Recipe Prompt Pattern**:
    
    - This pattern outputs a sequence of steps based on partial inputs. You can direct the model to guide you in creating prompts that assemble steps, like building a bookshelf.
    - **Example Task**: “Write a prompt to guide me through assembling a bookshelf with parts such as top and bottom panels, side panels, and shelves.”
2. **Template Pattern**:
    
    - This pattern provides a template for output. Useful for generating consistent, formatted responses like URLs or other structured text.
    - **Example Task**: “Create a prompt that generates a URL for a product page with the format `/product/id/name`.”
3. **Context Manager Pattern**:
    
    - This pattern allows you to add or remove specific contexts. For example, you might ask the model to focus on a historical topic.
    - **Example Task**: “Provide a prompt that generates a summary of a historical event, focusing only on events before 1900.”

#### Summary: Key Benefits of the Gameplay Pattern

- **Engagement**: Games make learning enjoyable and less monotonous.
- **Feedback and Iteration**: By receiving feedback, you can refine your prompts and learn from mistakes.
- **Customizability**: You can adjust the complexity and focus of the game by selecting different patterns and topics.

#### Practical Application

The gameplay pattern is ideal for anyone looking to deepen their prompt engineering skills. By structuring each task as a game with defined rules and expected outputs, it becomes a dynamic way to master the art of prompting, ultimately transforming the learning experience into an interactive skill-building exercise.

# Format of the Game Play Pattern

To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

- Create a game for me around X OR we are going to play an X game
    
- One or more fundamental rules of the game
    

You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate game topic, such as "math" or "cave exploration game to discover a lost language". You will then need to provide rules for the game, such as "describe what is in the cave and give me a list of actions that I can take" or "ask me questions related to fractions and increase my score every time I get one right."

Examples:

- Create a cave exploration game for me to discover a lost language. Describe where I am in the cave and what I can do. I should discover new words and symbols for the lost civilization in each area of the cave I visit. Each area should also have part of a story that uses the language. I should have to collect all the words and symbols to be able to understand the story. Tell me about the first area and then ask me what action to take.
    
- Create a group party game for me involving DALL-E. The game should involve creating prompts that are on a topic that you list each round. Everyone will create a prompt and generate an image with DALL-E. People will then vote on the best prompt based on the image it generates. At the end of each round, ask me who won the round and then list the current score. Describe the rules and then list the first topic.
