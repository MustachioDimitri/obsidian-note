Large language models often answer questions more accurately if they break a big question into smaller, related questions. By generating multiple sub-questions, the model can clarify details, gain context, and ultimately combine the answers to deliver a well-rounded response.

This is effective because:

1. **Models are trained on patterns of language**—they’ve likely seen related questions broken into steps, so they can predict what questions are relevant.
2. **Sub-questions add context**—they provide details that make the final answer more complete.
3. **Users benefit**—the approach shows users the various elements that matter for the answer, often clarifying aspects they hadn’t considered.

### How the Cognitive Verifier Pattern Works

To activate this approach, you can give a prompt like:

> "Whenever I ask a question, generate a few additional questions that would help answer it more accurately. Then combine the answers to produce a complete response."

Let’s go through an example to illustrate this pattern in action.

### Example of the Pattern

Imagine you’re curious about mosquito populations in your yard. You ask ChatGPT:

**You:** "How many mosquitoes probably live in my front yard?"

This is a broad question with several unknown factors, like yard size, location, and season. By using the Cognitive Verifier Pattern, ChatGPT will break this question down to gather more relevant details.

**ChatGPT’s Response (following the pattern):**

> "To help answer your question accurately, here are a few additional questions that would be useful:
> 
> 1. What is the size of your front yard?
> 2. What is the climate like in your area?
> 3. What time of year is it?
> 4. Are there any standing water sources nearby?
> 5. Are there plants or vegetation in your yard that could attract mosquitoes?"

#### Explanation of Each Question:

1. **Size of Yard** – Larger areas might support more mosquitoes, as there’s more space and potential breeding grounds.
2. **Climate** – Mosquito populations depend heavily on climate; tropical areas generally support more mosquitoes than dry or cold ones.
3. **Time of Year** – Mosquito populations are seasonal, typically peaking in warmer months.
4. **Standing Water** – Mosquitoes breed in stagnant water, so nearby water sources greatly increase their numbers.
5. **Vegetation** – Dense plants offer shade and humidity, creating an ideal environment for mosquitoes.

### Putting It All Together

After you answer each question, ChatGPT combines your answers to provide an estimate:

**You provide answers:**

1. "The yard is about 2,500 square feet."
2. "I live in a warm, humid area in the southeastern U.S."
3. "It’s April."
4. "No standing water sources nearby."
5. "There are a few plants that might attract mosquitoes."

**Final Answer from ChatGPT:**

> "Based on your yard size (2,500 sq. feet), warm climate in April, and vegetation, you might expect a few dozen to a few hundred mosquitoes in your yard. This number could vary depending on the specific vegetation and micro-climate, but without standing water nearby, it’s less likely to reach higher densities seen in other areas."

### Why This Works Well

1. **Comprehensive Answer**: The final answer is richer and more precise because it considers multiple factors.
2. **Enhanced Understanding**: Seeing the breakdown helps you learn which details are relevant to mosquito populations, so you’re better equipped to ask similar questions in the future.
3. **Reduced Ambiguity**: You get a nuanced answer with supporting reasoning, reducing the chances of misunderstandings or overgeneralizations.

### Another Quick Example

Suppose you ask, “How do I start a small business?”

**Using the Cognitive Verifier Pattern:**

ChatGPT might respond with:

1. "What type of business are you interested in?"
2. "What is your budget for starting the business?"
3. "Are there specific legal requirements or licenses needed?"
4. "Who is your target market?"
5. "What resources or expertise do you already have?"

With answers to these sub-questions, ChatGPT can give a far more tailored response that considers the type of business, budget, and other key details.

### Summary

The Cognitive Verifier Pattern is a great technique for:

- Turning broad or vague questions into structured, detailed answers.
- Revealing hidden aspects of the question that might otherwise be missed.
- Giving you a roadmap for understanding complex issues.

The goal is to allow the model to break down questions naturally, enhancing the depth and quality of the answers it provides.
