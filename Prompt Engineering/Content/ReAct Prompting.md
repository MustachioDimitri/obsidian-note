The main goal of **ReAct** is to teach a language model to recognize when it needs to use an external tool—like a web search, calculator, or video—for information it doesn’t have. This enables the model to handle tasks that it can’t solve on its own by interacting with other resources.

Here's how **ReAct** works and how you could set it up with prompts to "train" a model to think through processes and use outside tools. I'll follow with an example to solidify the approach.

### 1. **What is ReAct Prompting?**

- **ReAct** stands for **Reasoning and Action**. It combines two concepts:
    - **Reasoning**: The model thinks through each step required to solve a problem.
    - **Action**: The model determines when to use an external tool to get information, perform calculations, or verify results.
- This approach is similar to **Chain of Thought (CoT)** prompting (where the model thinks through steps), but it extends that idea by allowing the model to _take actions_—interacting with external sources and resources beyond its training data.

### 2. **Why ReAct is Useful**

- **Overcomes Information Limitations**: The model can only access knowledge up to its training cutoff date, so by learning to interact with real-time data sources (web search, APIs, etc.), it stays current.
- **Enhances Computation and Retrieval**: Some problems involve complex calculations or require very specific data that models are not inherently equipped to handle. **ReAct** allows the model to access a calculator, do database lookups, or pull video timestamps, for instance.
- **Automates Complex Workflows**: With **ReAct**, you can create prompts that enable the model to complete multi-step processes automatically by querying external sources as needed.

### 3. **How ReAct Prompting Works**

- **Provide a Clear Example Prompt**: Start by giving the model an example task and walking it through each thought and action step.
- **Define Actions Clearly**: Use specific “Action” keywords like `Action: search` or `Action: calculate`, to indicate when the model should use a tool, specifying the tool name and necessary input.
- **Return Hypothetical Results in the Prompt**: After each action, provide a mock result so the model can continue reasoning based on that response.
- **Iterate**: Once it completes each action, continue with reasoning based on the result, or decide on another action if needed.

### 4. **Detailed Example of ReAct Prompting**

Let’s go through a concrete example similar to the one given, with more detail and explanation at each stage.

#### Scenario

You need to calculate when to arrive at a BMX race for your child, based on the race schedule and the average length of previous races (called "motos"). Since this information isn’t in the model's training, it will need to:

- Find race start times
- Determine the number of motos ahead of your race
- Calculate the average time per moto

### Example Prompt Setup

Let's break down the **ReAct** prompt in steps.

#### Step 1: Define the Task and Initial Thought Process

1. **Task**: "Calculate when I need to arrive at the Music City BMX race for my son’s 9:00-10:00 race."
    
2. **Model's First Thought (Reasoning)**:
    
    - **Prompt**: “Think: I need to find out what time the first race begins. I can use a web search on the Music City BMX site to get that information.”
    
    Here, we are guiding the model’s thought process and showing that the first action should involve a search.
    
3. **Action Prompt**:
    
    - **Prompt**: “Action: search MusicCityBMX.com schedule”

#### Step 2: Hypothetical Result and Next Step

1. **Result**:
    
    - **Prompt**: “Result: All races start at 9:00 AM.”
2. **Next Thought**:
    
    - **Prompt**: “Think: Now I need to determine how many motos will run before the 9:00-10:00 open race. I’ll perform another search to find this.”
3. **Next Action**:
    
    - **Prompt**: “Action: search MusicCityBMX.com race order”
4. **Hypothetical Result**:
    
    - **Prompt**: “Result: There are 30 motos before the 9:00-10:00 open race.”

#### Step 3: Determine Average Time Per Moto

1. **Next Thought**:
    
    - **Prompt**: “Think: I need to find out how long each moto took last year on average. I can do this by watching the video livestream from the USA BMX website and timing the first 10 motos.”
2. **Action**:
    
    - **Prompt**: “Action: video USA BMX livestream”
3. **Hypothetical Result**:
    
    - **Prompt**: “Result: The first 10 motos took a total of 5 minutes, averaging 0.5 minutes per moto.”

---

#### Step 4: Final Calculation Based on Retrieved Data

1. **Final Thought**:
    
    - **Prompt**: “Think: If each moto takes an average of 0.5 minutes, 30 motos will take 15 minutes. Since the races start at 9:00 AM, I should arrive by 9:15 AM. To be safe, I’ll arrive 30 minutes early, at 8:45 AM.”
2. **Final Answer**:
    
    - **Prompt**: “Answer: To ensure my son is on time, we should arrive by 8:45 AM.”

### 5. **General Tips for Using ReAct Prompting**

- **Use Consistent Action Keywords**: This helps the model recognize each action type (e.g., `search`, `calculate`, `video`).
- **Provide Hypothetical Results for Each Action**: These act as examples that the model uses to understand how to proceed based on tool results.
- **Clearly Separate Reasoning from Actions**: Keep reasoning (thinking steps) and actions (tool usage) in distinct parts of the prompt.
- **Iterative Feedback**: With real tools, integrate feedback (i.e., actual results from web searches or calculations) and prompt the model to continue from that point.

### Putting It All Together

In an automated system, this setup could look something like this:

1. The model receives a question about a real-time event.
2. It reasons about which steps are necessary.
3. It identifies a tool to retrieve information it doesn't have (e.g., `search` or `calculate`).
4. The system executes the tool call, provides the result back to the model, and continues the cycle until completion.

By following this process, you can teach a language model to interact effectively with external resources, enabling it to answer complex, data-dependent questions in real time.
